# COMP9417  MACHINE LEARNING    YEAR: 2020  TERM: 02

# REPOSITORY GUIDE

## COMP9417_HW1

### SUMMARY

- Apply different classifier learning algorithms implemented in the Python scikit-learn machine learning library on a variety of datasets and answer questions based on anaylsis and intrepetation of the empirical results, using my knowledge of machine learning.

## COMP9417_HW2

### SUMMARY

- Apply parameter search for machine learning algorithms implemented in the Python scikit-learn machine learning library.
- Answer questions based on your analysis and interpretation of the empirical results of such applications, using your knowledge of machine learning.
- Complete an implementation of a different version of a learning algorithm you have previously seen.

## COMP9417_PROJECT

### SUMMARY

- Implement a ‘Transaction Fraud Prevention System’ leveraging machine learning models, which aims to predict whether a given financial transaction is ‘Fraudulent’ or ‘Valid’.

#  UPCOMING CHANGES IN REPOSITORY

- Self Reflection of the COMP9417 course as overall and individual self reflection for all the assessments of this course.
